### Project Description:

This project demonstrates how we can Build a simple team profile using backend development. The Directory Struture format created and using parent class as a blueprint to build a more structured and organised folder for our codes. 

How it works?
1. A command-line application which accepts user inputs.
2. There are 4 choices with 4 different functions.
3. There are 3 questions which all employees receieve. 
4. A function has been created which allows us to access the 4th questions for all 3 employees separately.
5. Once the 4th choice has been selected or all position has been met, the application exits and the Html is generated which displays the team profile.
